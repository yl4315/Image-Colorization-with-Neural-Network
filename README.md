# ECBM4040_FinalProject

##### This project is a literature review of a Neural Network paper "Deep Koalarization: Image Colorization using CNNs and Inception-Resnet-v2"

- The original paper suggests a model that combines its own deep convolutional neural network and features extracted from the Inception-ResNet-v2 pretrained model. The model successfully performs on colorizing high-level images such as the sea, forests, or the sky particularly; on image types that require smaller details; however, the model shows lower accuracy. The authors also conducted a user study to measure “public acceptance.” They ran their model with a reduced subset of ImageNet dataset to reduce running time; therefore, the network is expected to be improved when training over a larger dataset.
